# <span style="color: #ff5733;">About the Mod</span>
This is the first ever mod I have made for <span style="color: #4287f5;">Geometry Dash</span>.

This mod adds a button to the **Pause Menu** and **Main Menu**. The button tells you all sorts of quotes to help cheer up your day and hopefully help you beat a level.  
There are over <span style="color: #28a745;">100 different quotes</span> (101 exactly) which I made by taking inspiration from popular quotes.

There is an <span style="color: #f39c12;">extremely rare quote</span> which has a 0.01% chance. You can ping me in [<span style="color: #9b59b6;">My Discord Server</span>](https://discord.gg/wThzkVxKuF).  
If you want to submit quotes for me to add to the mod, join my [<span style="color: #9b59b6;">Discord</span>](https://discord.gg/wThzkVxKuF) and send it in the quote suggest forum.

## <span style="color: #8e44ad;">Contributor Badges</span>
Contributor badges are a cool way to show off your contribution of custom quotes.  
The number of quotes you contribute is represented by the <span style="color: #16a085;">Wisdom Points</span> stat.
