# About the Mod
This is the first ever mod i have ever made for Geometry Dash.

This mod adds a button to the pause menu and Main menu. The button tells you all sorts of quotes to help cheer up your day and hopefully help you beat a level. There are over 100 different quotes (101 Exactly) which i made by taking inspiration from popular quotes.

there is an extremely rare quote which has a 0.01% chance. You can dm me on Discord to let me know (@mobmastermind)
If you wanna submit quotes for me to add to the mod, Join my [Discord](http://dsc.gg/mobmastermind) and send it in the quote suggest forum.

# Custom Quotes
In this mod, you can add custom quotes Yourself. To do so, Simply click the settings icon on the bottom left of the settings menu of this mod. Then edit the "Custom.txt" File and add you own quotes. New quotes must be put on a new line.
