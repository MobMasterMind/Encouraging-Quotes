# <c1>About the Mod</c>
This is the first ever mod I have made for <c2>Geometry Dash</c>.

This mod adds a button to the **Pause Menu** and **Main Menu**. The button tells you all sorts of quotes to help cheer up your day and hopefully help you beat a level.  
There are over <c3>100 different quotes</c> (101 exactly) which I made by taking inspiration from popular quotes.

There is an <c4>extremely rare quote</c> which has a 0.01% chance. You can ping me in [<c5>My Discord Server</c>](https://discord.gg/wThzkVxKuF).  
If you want to submit quotes for me to add to the mod, join my [<c5>Discord</c>](https://discord.gg/wThzkVxKuF) and send it in the quote suggest forum.

2. Edit the "<c4>Custom.txt</c>" file and add your own quotes.  
3. Each new quote must be put on a new line.

## <c6>Contributor Badges</c>
Contributor badges are a cool way to show off your contribution of custom quotes.  
The number of quotes you contribute is represented by the <c3>Wisdom Points</c> stat.
